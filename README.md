Gives [letter_opener](https://github.com/ryanb/letter_opener) an interface for
browsing sent emails.

Check out [https://letter-opener-web.fly.dev](https://letter-opener-web.fly.dev) to see it in action.

## Installation

First add the gem to your development environment and run the `bundle` command to install it.

```ruby
group :development do
  gem 'letter_opener_web', '~> 2.0'
end
```

## Usage

Add to your routes.rb:

```ruby
Your::Application.routes.draw do
  mount LetterOpenerWeb::Engine, at: "/letter_opener" if Rails.env.development?
end
```

And make sure you have [`:letter_opener` delivery method](https://github.com/ryanb/letter_opener#rails-setup)
configured for your app. Then visit `http://localhost:3000/letter_opener` after
sending an email and have fun.

If you are running the app from a [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) machine or Docker
container, you might want to skip `letter_opener`'s `launchy` calls and avoid messages
like these:

```terminal
12:33:42 web.1  | Failure in opening /vagrant/tmp/letter_opener/1358825621_ba83a22/rich.html
with options {}: Unable to find a browser command. If this is unexpected, Please rerun with
environment variable LAUNCHY_DEBUG=true or the '-d' commandline option and file a bug at
https://github.com/copiousfreetime/launchy/issues/new
```

In that case (or if you really just want to browse mails using the web interface and
don't care about opening emails automatically), you can set `:letter_opener_web` as
your delivery method on your `config/environments/development.rb`:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :letter_opener_web
```

If you're using `:letter_opener_web` as your delivery method, you can change the location of
the letters by adding the following to an initializer (or in development.rb):

```ruby
LetterOpenerWeb.configure do |config|
  config.letters_location = Rails.root.join('your', 'new', 'path')
end
```

## Usage on pre-production environments

Some people use this gem on staging / pre-production environments to avoid having real emails
being sent out. To set that up you'll need to:

1. Move the gem out of the `development` group in your `Gemfile`
2. Set `config.action_mailer.delivery_method` on the appropriate `config/environments/<env>.rb`
3. Enable the route for the environments on your `routes.rb`.

In other words, your `Gemfile` will have:

```ruby
gem 'letter_opener_web'
```

And your `routes.rb`:

```ruby
Your::Application.routes.draw do
  # If you have a dedicated config/environments/staging.rb
  mount LetterOpenerWeb::Engine, at: "/letter_opener" if Rails.env.staging?

  # If you use RAILS_ENV=production in staging environments, you'll need another
  # way to disable it in "real production"
  mount LetterOpenerWeb::Engine, at: "/letter_opener" unless ENV["PRODUCTION_FOR_REAL"]
end
```

You might also want to have a look at the sources for the [demo](https://letter-opener-web.fly.dev)
available at https://github.com/fgrehm/letter_opener_web_demo.

**NOTICE: Using this gem on Heroku will only work if your app has just one Dyno
and does not send emails from background jobs. For updates on this matter please
subscribe to [GH-35](https://github.com/fgrehm/letter_opener_web/issues/35)**
